## MPL @ ShanghaiTech

MPL is part of the [ShanghaiTech Automation and Robotics Center (STAR Center)](https://star-center.shanghaitech.edu.cn/).

Our mission is to develop next-generation 3D perception systems for mobile applications, such as robots, intelligent vehicles, or intelligence augmentation devices (e.g. augmented reality headsets). Through our research, we hope to provide smart mobile machines and devices with the ability to see, to understand their environment using the sense of vision, and to perform useful tasks in the complex, unstructured, and dynamically changing environments in which we live and work. We work on robust, accurate, and efficient localization, 3D scene geometry perception, and scene understanding solutions, where the generated models of the environment cover everything reaching from low-level geometry to higher level aspects such as scene composition, object poses or shapes, dynamics, and semantic meaning. We achieve this goal by combining more classical model and optimization based methods with modern, data-driven techniques. We currently concentrate many of our efforts on the development of related solutions for neuro-morphic cameras. Our goal is to enable energy-efficient sensing and robotic vision in highly challenging scenarios involving extreme dynamics or illumination conditions.
